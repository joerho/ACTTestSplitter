quick outline of ACT program goals:
	Take in an act test and organize it in such a way that each combination of sections is outputted.
	Slap a cover page with the correct test number for each of the combination of sections.

	Potential steps to take in order to complete (subject to change)
		1.) convert each page in the pdf into individual images. Use png or jpg format.
		2.) iterate through each page (having saved each file with page number as its file name)
			a.) convert to gray scale or binary image
			b.) use OCR to match the water mark in the header as 1,2,3, or 4
			c.) group each section as soon as the water mark changes
		3.) clean up the image folder
		4.) create a new folder in the "Subject Separated" with the correct naming scheme (modus test number)
			a.) put each combination of sections into the folder above
			b.) create a new folder in this current folder named "Individual Sections"
				1.) add each individual section into this folder
